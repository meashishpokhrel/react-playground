From revisiting Virtual DOM + Unidirectional....

React Notes:::
------Virtual React DOM-----
1. React will copy the Actual DOm and name it Virtual DOM.
2. When changes is to be applied,React will now again copy the virtual dom and make changes to that specific component.
3. And now it compares the final virtual DOM with the actual DOM and see changes.
4. ANd now will apply the change in actual DOM.

---Asynchronous States------

1. State can be defined anywhere.
2. It is good practise to pass in props in constructor and super.
    Due to which i can now use this.props in constructor.
3. We can use simple state without constructor and super but cannot pass props then.
    This is alternate class syntax. IN regualar JavaSCript we cannot do.
4. State Updates are Asynchronous. (call of setState is Asynchronous)
5. Use function insetad of object when need to call state and props.

-----Life Cycle Components---------

Mounting--->Updating--->Unmounting
1. Mounting is the phase when the component is being put into the dom for the first time.
2. Calling Sequnce::
    First COnstructor gets called
    Then Render gets called
    Then LifeCycle Method ,CompnentDidMount Gets Called,
3.After this base state Updating phase starts,
    New Props, setstate, forceUpdate will trigger update.
    It calls Render first then
    calls CompoentDIdUpdate().

    ShouldComponentUpdate:
    It looks at the props and states and decides whether the componets should be rendered or not.
    When render is called then all the childrens are also called.
    so we use ShouldComponentUpdate
    When we donot want something unneccasary to render again ehich is not needed this it is used.
    It also helps to boast the performance.    

3. Last Phase is Unmounting phase:
    When i am not rendering anymore Then
    ComponetWillUnmount is called.
    After the given task is called it doesnot need to be called again so componentWillUnMount is called.
