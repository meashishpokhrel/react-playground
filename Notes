From revisiting Virtual DOM + Unidirectional....

React Notes:::

1. React will copy the Actual DOm and name it Virtual DOM.
2. When changes is to be applied,React will now again copy the virtual dom and make changes to that specific component.
3. And now it compares the final virtual DOM with the actual DOM and see changes.
4. ANd now will apply the change in actual DOM.
